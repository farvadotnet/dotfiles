Probatio Pennae¹
================

Is spellcheck a distraction? Probably. It's best suited for stupid, lazy students who truly could not care less. Nonetheless, it is a technically brilliant invention² that took a herculean effort to implement in the early days of electronic word processing.

Latin:      Abent omnes uolucres nidos inceptos nisi ego et tu quid expectamus nunc
Old Dutch³: Hebban olla uogala nestas hagunnan hinase hic enda thu uuat unbidan uue nu
Anglish:    Have all fowl begun nests, besides I and thou? What bide we now?
```

1. Pen Test.
2. Of course, this was first used mainly for [Scrabble](http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/cs542-spring2011/papers/appel-scrabble.pdf).
3. Or possibly Old English.



Sprachbund
==========

A sprachbund (German for "band of languages") is a group of languages that share common features due to geographical proximity. Languages in a sprachbund are not necessarily related but nonetheless end up intermingling and converge towards mutual intelligibility, at least temporarily.

West Germanic Sprachbund:
-------------------------

Dutch:   Heb je plannen voor de zomer?
English: Have you plans for the summer?

Frisian: Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis is goed Ingelsk en goed Frysk.
English: Butter, bread, and green cheese is good English and good Frise.

German:  Wo ist die Toilette?
English: Where is the toilet?
